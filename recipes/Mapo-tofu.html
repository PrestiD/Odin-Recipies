  <p><em>Mapo Tofu, Korean style</em></p>
  
  <p> Mapo Tofu, or <em>Mapadubu</em> as it is called in Korean, is a popular tofu dish that is eaten all throughout the world. While this dish has many variants and technically comes from China, the Korean variation is still incredibly popular. It is smoky, spicy, salty, and rich in a lot of flavors.  It's sharp taste in flavor is emblematic of popular dishes in Korean cuisine.</p>
  <p><em>Mapadubu</em> is special in that it is seen a Chinese dish, but heavily modified for Korean tastes.  It can be served at restaurants, but is frequently made at home as a quick dish. For people who aren't familiar with tofu dishes, this is a wonderful way to introduce somebody to a tofu dish that isn't bland or boring.</p>
  <p> <em>Mapadubu</em> is not emblematic of most Korean dishes.  There are many famous, more distinctly Korean dishes that use a variety of tofu styles and flavor combinations.  However, <em>Mapadubu's</em> simplicity, easiness to make, and short cooking time make it an excellent introduction to Korean cuisine. Additionally, for lovers of this dish or people who are familiar with the more famous Chinese variants, this is a fresh new take on a familiar dish that's especially tasty for those of us who love spicy foods!</p>
  <p>This particular recipe is version that I make at home, however there are also many famous versions available to learn from. Two of the most popular ones are American based youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj24Tb8Lmtc"> Maangchi</a> who teaches in English and Korean celebrity chef <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxpjY7TJ8g"> Paik Jeong-won</a> (available with English subtitles.) </p>
